packetization layer:

ESCAPE        = 0x34
ESCAPE_START  = 0x01
ESCAPE_END    = 0x02
ESCAPE_ESCAPE = 0x03

res = FF + ESCAPE + ESCAPE_START + data.replace(ESCAPE, ESCAPE + ESCAPE_ESCAPE) + ESCAPE + ESCAPE_END

CRC layer:

data has 4-byte CRC appended and then verified and stripped on receiving end

Address layer:

host to device: DEV_ID TYPE

Types defined:

0 host->bootloader
1 bootloader->host
2 host->program
3 program->host
